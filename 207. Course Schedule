//207. Course Schedule
//https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule
//The reason we start with a node that has indegree of 0 is because that mean the course has no dependencies
/*
BFS Solution: (Topological sorting)

The basic idea is to use Topological algorithm: put NODE with 0 indgree into the queue, then make indegree of NODE's successor dereasing 1. Keep the above steps with BFS.

Finally, if each node' indgree equals 0, then it is validated DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), which means the course schedule can be finished.
