Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area.

Example:

Input: 

1 0 1 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0

Output: 4

Algorithm

In the previous approach for calculating dp of i^{th}i 
th
  row we are using only the previous element and the (i-1)^{th}(i−1) 
th
  row. Therefore, we don't need 2D dp matrix as 1D dp array will be sufficient for this.

Initially the dp array contains all 0's. As we scan the elements of the original matrix across a row, we keep on updating the dp array as per the equation dp[j]=min(dp[j-1],dp[j],prev)dp[j]=min(dp[j−1],dp[j],prev), where prev refers to the old dp[j-1]dp[j−1]. For every row, we repeat the same process and update in the same dp array.
