Approach 3: Mathematics
We can use mathematics as follows

n = 3^i \\ i = \log_3(n) \\ i = \frac{\log_b(n)}{\log_b(3)}n=3 
i
 
i=log 
3
​	
 (n)
i= 
log 
b
​	
 (3)
log 
b
​	
 (n)
​	
 

n is a power of three if and only if i is an integer. In Java, we check if a number is an integer by taking the decimal part (using % 1) and checking if it is 0.
