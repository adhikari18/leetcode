Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of three.
Could you do it without using any loop / recursion?
*/

Approach 3: Mathematics
We can use mathematics as follows

n = 3^i \\ i = \log_3(n) \\ i = \frac{\log_b(n)}{\log_b(3)}n=3 
 

n is a power of three if and only if i is an integer. In Java, we check if a number is an integer by taking the decimal part (using % 1) and checking if it is 0.

public class Solution {
    public bool IsPowerOfThree(int n) {
        return (Math.Log10(n) / Math.Log10(3)) % 1 == 0;
    }
}
